Breakout Game

Welcome to the Breakout Game! This is a simple implementation of the classic arcade game Breakout, written in Python using the Pygame library. In this game, players control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks arranged at the top of the screen. The objective is to clear all the bricks while keeping the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen.

How to Play

Clone the repository or download the source code files to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your machine.
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the game files are located.

Run the game by executing the following command:

Copy code

python breakout.py

The game will start, and you'll see a paddle at the bottom of the screen, a ball, and a row of bricks at the top.
Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle horizontally, attempting to bounce the ball and hit the bricks.
If the ball hits a brick, the brick will disappear, and your score will increase.
If the ball falls off the bottom of the screen, you lose a life. The game ends when you lose all your lives or clear all the bricks.
You can restart the game by closing the window and running it again.
